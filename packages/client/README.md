Simon Colman assignment 2 Submission for cosc360

React web based version of the popular game Gomoku

Additional features include:

* Extra functionality around displayed elements on home page for sign in
* An improvement on the algorithm that I used from game 1, no longer storing all elements in the map, only elements that have been changed to active. Reducing the amount of memory usage
*  Tests implemented on key features start button active and disable on initial render and tests around the form for signing up.
